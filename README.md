# check-folder-size
A little project in python for checking folders and subfolders size. Useful when you are running low on disk space and want to identify heavy folders.

If you want to check admin/superuser protected folders, ensure you have enough permissions for such folders and files.

Made in Python 3.8.5 64-bit on Windows. Haven't checked other Python distributions / OS.
